== Description ==

*W3P Admin Login* is an easy-to-use plugin that allows you to safely change your website's admin login URL to anything you want. 

The plugin's simple two-step process ensures the safety of your admin login URL within seconds, and all of this without any coding. 

**Security against malicious activity** - Anyone can find your WordPress website's default login page, and this can increase the chances of security breaches like brute force attacks and other cyber threats. W3P Admin Login plugin allows you to change your admin login URL and redirect any user to a redirection URL.   

W3P Admin Login plugin does not rename or change files in the core but instead simply intercepts page requests and redirects to another URL. 

= Why use W3P Admin Login plugin? =

- Protect your website from brute force attacks.
- Quick two-step process that doesn't require coding.
- Easy to secure your website from hackers and cyber attacks.
- Only grant access to people you trust.
- Hide your login page from malicious activity. 
- Easier than creating a custom login URL.

**Redirect Custom Field**

Accessing the wp-login.php page or the `/wp-admin/` directory without logging in will redirect you to the page defined on the redirect custom field. Leaving the redirect custom field empty will activate the default settings (redirect to the website's homepage).

**Note** - After you activate this plugin, the `/wp-admin/` directory and `wp-login.php` page will become unavailable, so you should bookmark or remember the URL. Disabling this plugin brings your site back exactly to its previous state.
